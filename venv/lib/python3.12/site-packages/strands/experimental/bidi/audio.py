Provides acoustic echo cancellation, noise suppression, and automatic gain control for microphone input,

``BidiAudioIO`` to enable it. When echo cancellation is enabled, the agent's speaker output is used as a

    Passing an instance of this config to ``BidiAudioIO`` enables microphone processing via WebRTC. Requires

    Processing always applies noise suppression and automatic gain control to the microphone signal. Echo
    cancellation additionally removes the agent's own speaker audio from the mic input; it needs the speaker
    signal as a reference and therefore only works when the same ``BidiAudioIO`` produces both ``input()`` and
    ``output()``. Disable it for setups with no acoustic echo (for example a headset) while still benefiting
    from noise suppression and gain control.

    Attributes:
        echo_cancellation: Cancel the agent's own speaker audio from the mic input.
        stream_delay_ms: Playback-to-capture delay hint in ms for AEC. 0 lets AEC3 auto-estimate the delay.
